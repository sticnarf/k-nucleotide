# k-nucleotide
Fully concurrent implementation of [k-nucleotide](http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/performance.php?test=knucleotide) written in Rust.

This is an experimental implementation aimed at making the most of CPU cores. It may NOT run faster than other versions with lower cpu usage.
